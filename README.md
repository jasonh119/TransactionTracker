# Transaction Tracker

## Overview
This project is a Python application for my refreshing my engineering and coding skills and while doing a part time machine learning course.  I got bored with the datasets in the course and looked for something chunkier to build my own dataset from transaction history that is quite dirty and poorly formatted and from many different financial institutions. 

I then got carried away and connected it to gemini with a view to exploring using this with this dataset and others in future programmatically. 

First example is classifying expenses from transactions.  I haven't package this up properly yet and needs to implement a branching strategy if anyone wants to contribute. 

Necessity is the mother of invention.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
You will need Gemini free tier access to use the gemini API - save your key to environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

## Running Tests
To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```

```
